        <h4>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?</h4>
        <p>The only real trouble that I had with this assignment was finding a way to post a picture of myself. A number of photo sharing services such as Facebook and Google Photos give you the option to share a photo but the link is actually a link to a page on the give site and not a direct link to the photo file. However after a little bit of trial and error I was able to use OneDrive which has an embed feature that will generate the direct link to the photo. It will even generate the appropriate tags!</p>
        <h4>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h4>
        <p>I already knew that basics of the html tags and coding principles. However I was able to get familiarized with the OSU webspace procedures as well as the git and GitHub interface.</p>
        <h4>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h4>
        <p>The most useful resource was the w3 site for information on certain tags. I did find it nice that other students were asking and ansering questions on Piazza.</p>
